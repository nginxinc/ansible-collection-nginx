# Ansible NGINX Collection

The Ansible NGINX collection includes a variety of NGINX Ansible roles to help automate the installation and configuration of NGINX. This collection is maintained by NGINX.

**Note:** This collection is still in active development. There may be unidentified issues as development continues.

## Included Content

The current stable release (`0.4.0`) of the Ansible NGINX collection includes the following roles:

|Name|Description|Version|
|----|-----------|-------|
|[nginxinc.nginx](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx)|Install NGINX|0.21.3|

|[nginxinc.nginx_app_protect](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-app-protect)|Install and configure NGINX App Protect|0.7.0|

## Requirements

This collection has been developed and tested with [maintained](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html#release-status) versions of Ansible bigger than `2.11`. Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.

Instructions on how to install Ansible can be found in the [Ansible website](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).

You can also include the collection in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml

## Development

Currently, all the NGINX roles included in this collection (found in the [`roles/`](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-collection-nginx/blob/main/roles/) folder) are Git submodules, and work on the roles themselves should take place in the corresponding upstream role repository.

To update the roles included in this collection to their latest version, run `git submodule update --recursive --remote`.
