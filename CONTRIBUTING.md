## Getting Started

Follow our [Installation Guide](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-collection-nginx/blob/main/README.md#Installation) to install Ansible and get ready to use the NGINX Ansible collection.

### Project Structure

* The NGINX Ansible collection is written in `yaml` and supports NGINX Open Source, NGINX Plus and NGINX App Protect.
* The project follows the standard [Ansible collection directory structure](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_collections.html):
  * The main code is found at `roles/` (do note that all roles are Git submodules).
  * Sample playbooks and instructions can be found at `docs/`.

* Fill in [our pull request template](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-collection-nginx/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

Note: if you'd like to implement a new feature, please consider creating a feature request issue first to start a discussion about the feature.

## Code Guidelines

### Ansible Guidelines

* Run `molecule lint` over your code to automatically resolve a lot of `yaml` and Ansible style issues.
* Run `molecule test --all` on your code to catch any other issues.
* Follow these guides on some good practices for Ansible:
  * <https://www.ansible.com/blog/ansible-best-practices-essentials>
  * <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_best_practices.html>

### Git Guidelines

* Keep a clean, concise and meaningful git commit history on your branch (within reason), rebasing locally and squashing before submitting a PR
* Follow the guidelines of writing a good commit message as described here <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/> and summarized in the next few points:
  * In the subject line, use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
  * In the subject line, use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
  * Limit the subject line to 72 characters or less.
  * Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the subject line.
  * Add more detailed description in the body of the git message (`git commit -a` to give you more space and time in your text editor to write a good message instead of `git commit -am`).
